    <p class="article-text">
       Jose's taste for music started at an early age, being attracted to musical instruments since he was very young, specially keyboard-like ones. After he finished highschool he founded a rock band along with some friends, a project that wouldn't last too much and that was dissolved just for some of their members (Jose included) to join a new project called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHpBLBQlwic" target="_blank">Bareke Orquesta</a>, a latin music orchestra that was widely recognized in the region and that, in 2012 achieved to win a <i>"Congo de Oro"</i>, an important prize given by <a href="http://www.carnavaldebarranquilla.org/tradicion/congo-de-oro/festival-de-orquestas/" target="_blank">Carnaval de Barranquilla</a> (Barranquillaâ€™s Carnival, in English), the organization that makes the most important carnival of Colombia, and one of the most important Carnivals in the world. Jose left the orchestra in 2014 to dedicate more time to his career as a software engineer, but his love for music has been there all this time, and that's the reason because he decided to come back to the piano and music in general, exited about sharing his love for music with all of you.
